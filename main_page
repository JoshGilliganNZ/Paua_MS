# Pāua Heatwave Transcriptomics

This repository contains the analysis code, figure generation scripts, and manuscript files for the study of thermal stress responses in New Zealand pāua (*Haliotis iris*). The work investigates gene expression dynamics during controlled heatwave exposure and compares responses across three South Island populations.

## Overview

The repository provides:

- R scripts for processing, normalisation, differential expression, and visualisation  
- Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analyses and figure assembly  
- Metadata that defines samples, contrasts, and analysis parameters  
- Manuscript text, supplementary materials, and submission files  
- Instructions for reproducing the analysis from raw reads to final figures

Raw sequencing data are not stored here. Accession numbers will be added once the manuscript is accepted.

## Project structure

- `analysis/` R scripts, notebooks, and configuration files  
- `data/` processed data objects such as tximport outputs, count matrices, and VST transformations  
- `figures/` figure panels and plotting code  
- `manuscript/` main text and supplementary materials

## Reproducibility

All analyses were conducted in R using Bioconductor packages. Version information is recorded within the scripts and notebooks. The repository structure allows full reproduction of the results using the processed data, and complete regeneration of the analysis if raw data are available.

## Citation

If you use any part of this workflow, please cite the manuscript once it has been published. A `CITATION.cff` file is provided for automated citation formatting.
